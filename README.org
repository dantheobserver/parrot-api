** Setting up development Environment

This project uses tools.deps, to run an nrepl on port 9000 call:

~clojure -A:nrepl~

Included is a dev alias that allows you to run a development jetty server that reloads the aplicaition on file changes.  The command is:

~clojure -A:dev~

This can work in conjunction with the nrepl by calling: 

~clojure -A:dev:nrepl~

When the nrepl is started it will run the usr.clj in the dev directory and expose ~(start)~ and ~(stop)~ wich will start and stop the dev server manually.
